                        Instruction Book

Hello, and welcome you to the instruction book to my Game “ The CatFather: Meow Beginning.”
here I will go over basic movements and guide you on what you can expect playing.
Character

Man (Player): After seeing his family die at the hands of the Mouse Mafia one man called man
sets out to take out his revenge on the ones who messed it up in the first place. Armed with his
trusty rifle Man will shoot down the main office and the Mafia’s dorm on his path towards
vengeance.

Mouse Men (Enemies): Mice men work for the high encompassed Mouse Mafia owning tons of
building and property, and don’t like it when someone unwanted is on their turf. The Mouse men
will follow the player around the room with a NavMesh Agent attached to them and will go
around any obstacle to get to you. So, be mindful of your surroundings, and if they’re behind
you try to use the obstacles as an advantage to get them to the front

                        Movement:
WASD: These are the basic movement on the game with A and D taking the character left and
right and W and S going up and down, However, the player cannot rotate or turn when going in
any direction so use the environment to your advantage to get the enemies in front of you.
Space: Pressing the Space bar is how you fire your gun, it is not where you can just keep
pressing down and it will shoot, you will have to repeatedly press it for the gun to shoot.

                        Environment:
The main Office: The main office of the Mouse mafia operates in. the player is only facing the
front but the Mice are following it would be wise to lead them around the pillar and office desk to
make sure they are in front of you.

The Dorms: The dorms hold all the newly initiated mouse men, meaning it’s the perfect place to
attack. The Dorms don’t have any pillar to get the enemies to go around in, but if you can get
into a room a have them come in one
